# Assignment-Two-Week-Two
- The requirements I achieved were: I implemented responsive design to ensure the website works well on small mobile screens and larger desktop screens which can be above 800px; I implemented a media query so the website is viewed differently on mobile view compared to desktop view.; All of my images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility; I used event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.
- I added some extras: I added an audio link; I added play and pause buttons; I added a marquee; I added a horizontal navigation bar; I made the background colour of my website pink;I added a footer and copyright section to my website.
- Some things I was unable to achieve were making the audio link work, making the play and pause buttons work and making the navigation bar links work.
- I found it difficult to make the buttons, audio link and the navigation bar links work. Please may I have some feedback on how to do this.
- I found the website W3School useful for learning to code.
