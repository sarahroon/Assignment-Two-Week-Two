# Assignment-Two-Week-Two
- The requirements I achieved for my image gallery website were: I implemented responsive design to ensure the website works well on small mobile screens and larger desktop screens which can be above 800px; I implemented a media query so the website is viewed differently on mobile view compared to desktop view so on mobile view for a smaller screen the website background colour is pink and on desktop view for a bigger screen the website background colour is green; I gave all of my images appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility; I used an event handler to switch an image based on a user interaction so when the user clicks on an image in the image gallery and presses the 'e' key on their keyboard the image is described to them and they can interact with the image following the commands described to them by voice over displayed on the screen. This is useful for blind users who use voice over with image description turned on when visiting websites.
- I added some extras: I added a marquee; I added a horizontal navigation bar; I made the background colour of my website green for smaller screens on mobile and pink for smaller screens on desktop and green for bigger screens on desktop, I added a footer and copyright section to my website.
- Some minor things I was unable to achieve were making the navigation bar links direct website users to Home, About and Contact.
- I found it difficult to make the navigation bar links direct website users to Home, About and Contact. Please may I have some feedback on how to do this.
- I found the website W3School useful for learning to code.
