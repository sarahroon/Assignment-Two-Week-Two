- The requirements I achieved were: I implemented responsive design to ensure the website works well on small mobile screens and larger desktop screens which can be above 800px; I implemented a media query so the thumbnail bar is positioned differently on mobile view compared to desktop view.; All of my images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.; I used event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.
- I added some extras such as play and pause buttons for the audio link, and I added a marquee and a horizontal navigation bar.
- Some requirements I was unable to achieve were making audio link and play and pause buttons functional and making the navigation bar functional.
- I found it difficult to make buttons, audio links and the navigation bar functional. Please may I have some feedback on how to do this.
- I found the website W3School useful for learning to code.
